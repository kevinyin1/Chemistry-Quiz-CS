            In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.

The atomic number, Z, should not be confused with the mass number, A, which is the number of nucleons, the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The number of neutrons, N, is known as the neutron number of the atom; thus, A = Z + N (these quantities are always whole numbers). Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in unified atomic mass units (making a quantity called the "relative isotopic mass"), is roughly (to within 1%) equal to the whole number A.

Atoms with the same atomic number Z but different neutron numbers N, and hence different atomic masses, are known as isotopes. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see monoisotopic elements), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.

The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl meaning number/numeral/figure, which, prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word Atomzahl (and its English equivalent atomic number) come into common use in this context.

		<h1>Groups</h1>

             	<p>
              The group number is an identifier used to describe the column of the standard periodic table in which the element appears.
Groups 1-2 (except hydrogen) and 13-18 are termed main group elements.
Groups 3-11 are termed transition elements. Transition elements are those whose atoms have an incomplete d-subshell or whose cations have an incomplete d-subshell.
Main group elements in the first two rows of the table are called typical elements.
The first row of the f-block elements are called lanthanoids (or, less desirably, lanthanides. The second row of the f-block elements are called actanoids (or, less desirably, actanides.
The following names for specific groups in the periodic table are in common use:

			Group 1: alkali metals
			Group 2: alkaline earth metals
			Group 11: coinage metals (not an IUPAC approved name)
			Group 15: pnictogens (not an IUPAC approved name)
			Group 16: chalcogens
			Group 17: halogens
			Group 18: noble gases
In addition, groups may be idenitifed by the first element in each group - so the Group 16 elements is sometimes called the oxygen group.

Group Trends for the Active Metals
The alkali metals (group 1A) and the alkaline earth metals (group 2A) are often called the active metals. Group 1A: The Alkali Metals 
Alkali metals are all soft.
Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their single s electron: MM+ + e– Reactivity increases as we move down the group.
Alkali metals react with hydrogen to form hydrides. 
In hydrides, the hydrogen is present as H–, called the hydride ion. 2M(s) + H2(g)2MH(s) 

Alkali metals 
Alkali metals  
 
 Alkali metals 
react with water to form MOH and hydrogen gas: 2M(s) + 2H2O(l) 2MOH(aq) + H2(g) produce different oxides when reacting with O2: 
Nonmetal oxide + wateracid CO2(g) + H2O(l)H2CO3(aq) P4O10(s) + 6H2O(l)4H3PO4(aq) 

4Li(s) + O2(g)2Li2O(s)
2Na(s) + O2 (g) Na2O2(s)
K(s) + O2 (g)KO2(s)
emit characteristic colors when placed in a high-temperature flame. 
(oxide) (peroxide) (superoxide) 
The s electron is excited by the flame and emits energy when it returns to the ground state. The Na line occurs at 589 nm (yellow), characteristic of the 3p3s transition.
The Li line is crimson red.
The K line is lilac. 
Group 2A: The Alkaline Earth Metals 
Alkaline earth metals are harder and more dense than the alkali metals. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of two s electrons: Reactivity increases down the group. 
Be does not react with water.
Mg will only react with steam.
Ca and the elements below it react with water at room temperature as follows: 
Ca(s) + 2H2O(l)Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g) 
7.8 Group Trends for Selected Nonmetals 
Hydrogen 
Hydrogen is a unique element.
It most often occurs as a colorless diatomic gas, H2.
Reactions between hydrogen and nonmetals can be very exothermic: 
2H2(g) + 2O2(g)2H2O(l) ∆Hf o = –571.7 kJ 
Nonmetal oxide + basesalt + water
CO2(g) + 2NaOH(aq)Na2CO3(aq) + H2O(l) 
MM2+ + 2e– Mg(s) + Cl2(g)MgCl2(s) 
2Mg(s) + O2(g)2MgO(s) 
 
It can either gain another electron to form the hydride ion, H–, or lose its electron to become H+: 2Na(s) + H2(g)2NaH(s) 
2H2(g) + O2(g)2H2O(l) H+ is a proton.The aqueous chemistry of hydrogen is dominated by H+(aq). 
Group 6A: The Oxygen Group 
As we move down the group the metallic character increases. O2 is a gas, Te is a metalloid, Po is a metal. There are two important forms of oxygen: O2 and ozone, O3. 
O2 and O3 are allotropes.
Allotropes are different forms of the same element in the same state (in this case, gaseous). 
Ozone can be prepared from oxygen: 
Ozone is pungent and toxic. 
3O2(g)2O3(g) ∆Hfo = +284.6 kJ 
Oxygen (or dioxygen, O2) is a potent oxidizing agent since the O2– ion has a noble gas configuration. There are two oxidation states for oxygen: –2 (e.g., H2O) and –1 (e.g., H2O2).
Sulfur is another important member of this group. 
The most common form of sulfur is yellow S8. Sulfur tends to form S2– in compounds (sulfides). 
Group 7A: The Halogens 
Group 7A elements are known as the halogens ("salt formers").
The chemistry of the halogens is dominated by gaining an electron to form an anion: 
X2 + 2e– 2X– Fluorine is one of the most reactive substances known: 
2F2(g) + 2H2O(l)4HF(aq) + O2(g) ∆H = –758.9 kJ All halogens consist of diatomic molecules, X2. 
Chlorine is the most industrially useful halogen.
The reaction between chorine and water produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is used to disinfect swimming pool water: 
Cl2(g) + H2O(l)HCl(aq) + HOCl(aq) Halogens react with hydrogen to form gaseous hydrogen halide compounds: 
H2(g) + X2 2HX(g)
Hydrogen compounds of the halogens are all strong acids with the exception of HF. 
Group 8A: The Noble Gases 
The group 8A elements are known as the noble gases.
These are all nonmetals and monoatomic.
They are notoriously unreactive because they have completely filled s and p subshells. 
In 1962 the first compounds of the noble gases were prepared: XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6.

		<h1>Metals vs Non-metals</h1>
		<img src="images//4.png" alt="MvsNM">
              	<p>
              Metals appear lustrous, form mixtures (alloys) when combined with other metals, and tend to lose or share electrons when they react with other substances; and each forms at least one predominantly basic oxide.

Most metals are silvery looking, high density, relatively soft and easily deformed solids with good electrical and thermal conductivity, closely packed structures, low ionisation energies and electronegativities, and are found naturally in combined states.

Some metals appear coloured (Cu, Cs, Au), have low densities (e.g. Be, Al) or very high melting points, are liquids at or near room temperature, are brittle (e.g. Os, Bi), not easily machined (e.g. Ti, Re), or are noble (hard to oxidise) or have nonmetallic structures (Mn and Ga are structurally analogous to, respectively, white P and I).

Metals comprise the large majority of the elements, and can be subdivided into several different categories. From left to right in the periodic table, these categories include the highly reactive alkali metals; the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and radioactive actinides; the archetypal transition metals, and the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. Specialized subcategories such as the refractory metals and the noble metals also exist.

Metalloids are metallic looking brittle solids; tend to share electrons when they react with other substances; have weakly acidic or amphoteric oxides; and are usually found naturally in combined states.

Most are semiconductors, and moderate thermal conductors, and have structures that are more open than those of most metals.

Some metalloids (As, Sb) conduct electricity like metals.

The metalloids, as the smallest major category of elements, are not subdivided further.

Nonmetals have open structures (unless solidified from gaseous or liquid forms); tend to gain or share electrons when they react with other substances; and do not form distinctly basic oxides.

Most are gases at room temperature; have relatively low densities; are poor electrical and thermal conductors; have relatively high ionisation energies and electronegativities; form acidic oxides; and are found naturally in uncombined states in large amounts.

Some nonmetals (C, black P, S and Se) are brittle solids at room temperature (although each of these also have malleable, pliable or ductile allotropes).

From left to right in the periodic table, the nonmetals can be subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are almost completely inert.
