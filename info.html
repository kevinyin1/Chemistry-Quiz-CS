              <h1>Atomic Structure</h1>
              <p>
              An atom is the smallest part of an element that retains the properties of that element. The concept of an atom goes a long way back. It was first suggested by an ancient Greek named Democritus (the Greek word "atomos" means indivisible). Democritus theorized that if you took an object and cut it in half again and again you would eventually end up with some particle which could not be further divided. 
In the early 1800's an English scientist by the name of John Dalton started relating what chemists could see tthe concept of the atom. He came up with an atomic theory which could be stated as follows: 
All elements are composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms.
Atoms of the same element are identical and differ from atoms of other elements.
Atoms of different elements can combine together in simple whole number ratios tform 
compounds.
Chemical reactions are the rearranging of the combinations of atoms of elements in compounds. The 
atoms themselves remain unchanged.
Atoms are composed of three primary particles, protons, neutrons and electrons.

amu (atomic mass unit = 1.66 x 10-24 grams) 
The electron was discovered by the English physicist Sir Joseph J. Thomson around 1897 with the use of a cathode ray tube. A cathode ray tube is similar tyour TV. It has an anode (negative electrode) and a cathode (positive electrode). These are enclosed in an evacuated (air removed) glass container and when a charge is applied the electrons flow from anode tcathode through the open space of the glass container. Thomson observed these particles and determined that the particles: 
move at a very high speed 
have a negative charge 
have a mass of about 1/2000 of a hydrogen atom (smallest atom) 
were the same regardless of which gas was used in the container or the metal used as the electrode 
The particles were eventually named "electrons." His model of the atom was the “plum-pudding” model. This discovery shattered Dalton's notion of an atom. TDalton atoms were tiny, solid particles, not containing smaller particles. 
The nucleus was discovered by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. Rutherford set up an apparatus in which he aimed alpha particles (type of radiation made up of helium nuclei) at a very thin sheet of gold foil. If the atoms were made up of evenly dispersed protons and electrons, as believed at the time, the alpha particles should gstraight through unhindered. What happened was that some of the alpha particles went through; some were deflected as they passed through and some bounced back. Rutherford concluded that the positive mass of the atom (protons) must be concentrated in a very small area and most of the rest of the atom must be empty space. The area where the protons were located was called the nucleus. 
The nucleus of an atom is extremely small as compared tthe entire size of the atom. It can be compared tthe size of a marble in a football stadium where the marble represents the nucleus and the stadium the entire atom. Most of the space of the atom is occupied by the orbiting electrons. 
Structure of the Nucleus: 1. Protons 
a. Positive charge, mass of 1.673x10-27 kg
b. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the atom's identity and is called the atomic number 
2. Neutrons
a. Ncharge, mass of 1.675x10-27 kg 
The different historical models are described as follows: 
Dalton's model of the atom - solid, tiny, indivisible particles. 
Thomson's model - often describe as the "plum pudding" model - electrons are 
scattered throughout the atom. 
Rutherford's model - includes the solid nucleus in the center of the atom. 
Sir James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932. Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment: 
a. Electron is negatively charged
b. Mass is about 1/2000th of a hydrogen atom 
(a) Electron mass is 9.109 x 10-31 kg 
Atomic number - indicates the number of protons and defines the element (atomic number 6 is always carbon, atomic number 7 is always nitrogen etc.). 
Mass number - equals the total number of neutrons and protons in the nucleus of an atom for the most common isotope this equals the atomic mass rounded off tthe nearest whole number 
Atomic mass - the average mass of an atom of an element (in amu) 
Calculation of the number of particles in an atom of an element : - number of protons equals the atomic number 
- number of neutrons equals the mass number minus the atomic number (remember virtually all the mass is from the neutrons and protons in the nucleus-each with an amu of 1) 
- number of electrons equals the number of protons in a neutral atom
Consider the following periodic table information for carbon, nitrogen and sodium : 
Carbon's atomic number is 6, has an average mass of 12.011 amu and carbon's most common isotope has a mass number of 12 amu. Therefore, the most common type of carbon atom has 6 protons, 6 neutrons and 6 electrons. 
Nitrogen's atomic number is 7, has an average mass of 14.007 amu and nitrogen's most common isotope has a mass of 14 amu. Therefore the most common type of nitrogen atom has 7 protons, 7 neutrons and 7 electrons. 
Sodium's atomic number is 11, has an average mass of 22.990 amu and nitrogen's most common isotope has a mass of 23 amu. Therefore the most common type of sodium atom has 11 protons, 12 neutrons and 11 electrons. 
An isotope is a particular form of an atom of an element. Isotopes have a different number of neutrons and therefore differ in mass (that is why there is a non-whole number atomic mass which is an average of the various isotopes). The number of protons is always the same in isotopes since they are different forms of the same element (must be same atomic number).

              <h1>Bonding</h1>
<p>
To understand bonding, we must first review basic concepts about structure and atoms. Lewis structures give atomic connectivity: they tell us which atoms are physically connected to which atoms. The shape of a molecule is determined by its bond angles.
The angles made by the lines joining the nuclei of the atoms in a molecule are the bond angles. Consider CCl4:
Experimentally we find all Cl–C–Cl bond angles are 109.5°.
Therefore, the molecule cannot be planar.
All Cl atoms are located at the vertices of a tetrahedron with the C at its center.
In order to predict molecular shape, we assume that the valence electrons repel each other. Therefore, the molecule adopts the three-dimensional geometry that minimizes this repulsion. We call this model the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model.
The VSEPR Model
A covalent bond forms between two atoms when a pair of electrons occupies the space between the atoms.
This is a bonding pair of electrons.
Such a region is an electron domain.
A nonbonding pair or lone pair of electrons defines an electron domain located principally on one atom. Example: NH3 has three bonding pairs and one lone pair.
VSEPR predicts that the best arrangement of electron domains is the one
   that minimizes the repulsions among them.
The arrangement of electron domains about the central atom of a molecule is its electron-domain geometry.
There are five different electron-domain geometries:
linear (two electron domains), trigonal planar (three domains), tetrahedral (four domains), trigonal bipyramidal (five domains) and octahedral (six domains).
The molecular geometry is the arrangement of the atoms in space. To determine the shape of a molecule we must distinguish between
lone pairs and bonding pairs.
We use the electron-domain geometry to help us predict the molecular geometry.
Draw the Lewis structure.
Count the total number of electron domains around the central atom.
Arrange the electron domains in one of the five geometries to minimize electron-electron repulsion.
Next, determine the 3-D structure of the molecule.
We ignore lone pairs in the molecular geometry. Describe the molecular geometry in terms of the the bonded atoms.
Multiple bonds are counted as one electron domain.
The Effect of Nonbonding Electrons and Multiple Bonds on Bond Angles
We refine VSEPR to predict and explain slight distortions from “ideal” geometries. Consider three molecules with tetrahedral electron domain geometries: CH4, NH3, and H2O.
angular arrangement of
By experiment, the H–X–H bond angle decreases from C (109.5° in CH4) to N (107° in NH3) to O (104.5° in H2O). A bonding pair of electrons is attracted by two nuclei. They do not repel as much as lone pairs which are primarily attracted by only one nucleus.
Electron domains for nonbonding electron pairs thus exert greater repulsive forces on adjacent electron domains.
They tend to compress the bond angles.
The bond angle decreases as the number of nonbonding pairs increases.Similarly, electrons in multiple bonds repel more than electrons in single bonds (e.g., in Cl2CO the O–C–Cl angle is 124.3°, and the Cl–C–Cl bond angle is 111.4°).
 We will encounter eleven basic molecular shapes:
three atoms (AB2): linear
bent

trigonal planar trigonal pyramidal
t-shaped
five atoms (AB4): tetrahedral
square planar seesaw
six atoms (AB5): trigonal bipyramidal square pyramidal

        Molecules with Expanded Valence Shells
Atoms that have expanded octets have five electron domains (trigonal bipyramidal) or six electron domains (octahedral) electron-domain geometries.
Trigonal bipyramidal structures have a plane containing three electron pairs.
The fourth and fifth electron pairs are located above and below this plane. In this structure two trigonal pyramids share a base.
For octahedral structures, there is a plane containing four electron pairs.
Similarly, the fifth and sixth electron pairs are located above and below this plane. Two square pyramids share a base.
Consider a trigonal bipyramid.
The three electron pairs in the plane are called equatorial.
The two electron pairs above and below this plane are called axial.
The axial electron pairs are 180° apart and 90° to the equatorial electrons.
The equatorial electron pairs are 120° apart.
To minimize electron–electron repulsion, nonbonding pairs are always placed in equatorial positions and bonding pairs are placed in either axial or equatorial positions.
Consider an octahedron.
The four electron pairs in the plane are at 90° to each other.
The two axial electron pairs are 180° apart and at 90° to the electrons in the plane.
Because of the symmetry of the system, each position is equivalent.
If we have five bonding pairs and one lone pair, it does not matter where the lone pair is placed.
 The molecular geometry is square pyramidal.If two non-bonding pairs are present, the repulsions are minimized by pointing them toward opposite sides of the octahedron.The molecular geometry is square planar.
 Shapes of Larger Molecules
In acetic acid, CH3COOH, there are three interior atoms: two C and one O.
We assign the molecular (and electron-domain) geometry about each interior atom separately:
The geometry around the first C is tetrahedral.
The geometry around the second C is trigonal planar. The geometry around the O is bent (tetrahedral).
Molecular Shape and Molecular Polarity
Polar molecules interact with electric fields.
We previously saw that binary compounds are polar if their centers of negative and positive charge do not coincide.
If two charges, equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, are separated by a distance d, then a dipole is established. The dipole moment, μ is given by μ = Qr where Q is the magnitude of the charge.
We can extend this to polyatomic molecules.
For each bond in a polyatomic molecule, we can consider the bond dipole.
The dipole moment due only to the two atoms in the bond is the bond dipole.
Because bond dipoles and dipole moments are vector quantities, the orientation of these individual dipole moments
determines whether the molecule has an overall dipole moment.
In CO2 each ∂+C−O∂– dipole is canceled because the molecule is linear. In H2O, the ∂+H−O∂– dipoles do not cancel because the molecule is bent.
It is possible for a molecule with polar bonds to be either polar or nonpolar. Example:
For diatomic molecules:
polar bonds always result in an overall dipole moment.
For triatomic molecules:
if the molecular geometry is bent, there is an overall dipole moment.
if the molecular geometry is linear and the B atoms are the same, there is no overall dipole moment.
if the molecular geometry is linear and the B atoms are different, there is an overall dipole moment. For molecules with four atoms:
if the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal, there is an overall dipole moment.
if the molecular geometry is trigonal planar and the B atoms are identical, there is no overall dipole μ.
if the molecular geometry is trigonal planar and the B atoms are different, there is an overall dipole μ. 
Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap
Lewis structures and VSEPR theory give us the shape and location of electrons in a molecule.
They do not explain why a chemical bond forms.
How can quantum mechanics be used to account for molecular shape? What orbitals are involved in bonding? We use valence-bond theory.
A covalent bond forms when the orbitals on two atoms overlap.
The shared region of space between the orbitals is called the orbital overlap.
There are two electrons (usually one from each atom) of opposite spin in the orbital overlap. As two nuclei approach each other their atomic orbitals overlap.
As the amount of overlap increases, the energy of the interaction decreases. At some distance the minimum energy is reached.
The minimum energy corresponds to the bonding distance (or bond length).
As the two atoms get closer, their nuclei begin to repel and the energy increases.
At the bonding distance, the attractive forces between nuclei and electrons just balance the repulsive forces (nucleus-nucleus, electron-electron).
Hybrid Orbitals
We can apply the idea of orbital overlap and valence-bond theory to polyatomic molecules.
sp Hybrid Orbitals
Consider the BeF2 molecule.
Be has a 1s22s2 electron configuration.
There is no unpaired electron available for bonding.
We conclude that the atomic orbitals are not adequate to describe orbitals in molecules.
We know that the F–Be–F bond angle is 180° (VSEPR theory).
We also know that one electron from Be is shared with each one of the unpaired electrons from F.
We assume that the Be orbitals in the Be–F bond are 180° apart.We could promote an electron from the 2s orbital on Be to the 2p orbital to get two unpaired electrons for bonding. BUT the geometry is still not explained.
 We can solve the problem by allowing the 2s and one 2p orbital on Be to mix or form two new hybrid orbitals (a process called hybridization). The two equivalent hybrid orbitals that result from mixing an s and
a p orbital and are called sp hybrid orbitals.
The two lobes of an sp hybrid orbital are 180° apart.
According to the valence-bond model, a linear arrangement of
electron domains implies sp hybridization.
Since only one of 2p orbitals of Be has been used in hybridization, there
are two unhybridized p orbitals remaining on Be.
The electrons in the sp hybrid orbital form shared electron bonds with the two fluorine atoms.
sp2 and sp3 Hybrid Orbitals
Important: when we mix n atomic orbitals we must get n hybrid orbitals.
Three sp2 hybrid orbitals are formed from hybridization of one s and two p orbitals.
Thus, there is one unhybridized p orbital remaining.
The large lobes of the sp2 hybrids lie in a trigonal plane.
Molecules with trigonal planar electron-pair geometries have sp2 orbitals on the central atom.
Four sp3 hybrid orbitals are formed from hybridization of one s and three p orbitals. Therefore, there are four large lobes.
Each lobe points towards the vertex of a tetrahedron.
The angle between the large lobes is 109.5°.
Molecules with tetrahedral electron pair geometries are sp3 hybridized. Hybridization Involving d Orbitals
Since there are only three p orbitals, trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral electron-pair geometries must involve d orbitals.
Trigonal bipyramidal electron pair geometries require sp3d hybridization. Octahedral electron pair geometries require sp3d2 hybridization. Electron pair VSEPR geometry corresponds well with the hybridization.
Use of d orbitals in making hybrid orbitals corresponds well with the idea of an expanded octet.
Summary- We need to know the electron-domain geometry before we can assign hybridization.
To assign hybridization:
Draw a Lewis structure.
Assign the electron-domain geometry using VSEPR theory.
Specify the hybridization required to accommodate the electron pairs based on their geometric arrangement. Name the geometry by the positions of the atoms.
Multiple Bonds- In the covalent bonds we have seen so far the electron density has been concentrated symmetrically about the internuclear axis.
Sigma (σ) bonds: electron density lies on the axis between the nuclei. All single bonds are σ bonds.
What about overlap in multiple bonds?
Pi (π) bonds: electron density lies above and below the plane of the nuclei.
A double bond consists of one σ bond and one π bond. Bond Order A triple bond has one σ bond and two π bonds.
Bond order = 1 for a single bond. Bond order = 2 for a double bond. Bond order = 3 for a triple bond.
Often, the p orbitals involved in π bonding come from unhybridized orbitals. For example: ethylene, C2H4, has:
One σ and one π bond.
Both C atoms are sp2 hybridized.
Both C atoms have trigonal planar electron-pair and molecular geometries.
For example: acetylene, C2H2:The electron-domain geometry of each C is linear. Therefore, the C atoms are sp hybridized.The sp hybrid orbitals form the C–C and C–H σ bonds. There are two unhybridized p orbitals on each C atom.
Both unhybridized p orbitals form the two π bonds;
One π bond is above and below the plane of the nuclei; One π bond is in front and behind the plane of the nuclei.
For triple bonds, one π bond is always above and below and the other is in front and behind the plane of the nuclei.
Delocalized π Bonding- So far all the bonds we have encountered are localized between two nuclei.
In the case of benzene:
There are six C–C σ bonds and six C–H σ bonds.
Each C atom is sp2 hybridized.
There is one unhybridized p orbital on each carbon atom, resulting in six unhybridized carbon p orbitals in a ring.
In benzene there are two options for the three π bonds:
localized between carbon atoms or
delocalized over the entire ring (i.e., the π electrons are shared by all six carbon atoms).
Experimentally, all C–C bonds are the same length in benzene. Therefore, all C–C bonds are of the same type (recall single bonds are longer than double bonds).
General Conclusions
Every pair of bonded atoms shares one or more pairs of electrons.
Two electrons shared between atoms on the same axis as the nuclei are σ bonds.
σ bonds are always localized in the region between two bonded atoms.
If two atoms share more than one pair of electrons, the additional pairs form π bonds. When resonance structures are possible, delocalization is also possible.

              <h1>Atomic Numbers</h1>
              <p> 
              In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.

  The atomic number, Z, should not be confused with the mass number, A, which is the number of nucleons, the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The number of neutrons, N, is known as the neutron number of the atom; thus, A = Z + N (these quantities are always whole numbers). Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in unified atomic mass units (making a quantity called the "relative isotopic mass"), is roughly (to within 1%) equal to the whole number A.

  Atoms with the same atomic number Z but different neutron numbers N, and hence different atomic masses, are known as isotopes. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see monoisotopic elements), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.

  The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl meaning number/numeral/figure, which, prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word Atomzahl (and its English equivalent atomic number) come into common use in this context.
