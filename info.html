              Molecular Shapes
•Lewis structures give atomic connectivity: they tell us which atoms are physically connected to which atoms. •The shape of a molecule is determined by its bond angles.
•The angles made by the lines joining the nuclei of the atoms in a molecule are the bond angles. •Consider CCl4:
•Experimentally we find all Cl–C–Cl bond angles are 109.5°.
•Therefore, the molecule cannot be planar.
•All Cl atoms are located at the vertices of a tetrahedron with the C at its center.
•In order to predict molecular shape, we assume that the valence electrons repel each other. •Therefore, the molecule adopts the three-dimensional geometry that minimizes this repulsion. •We call this model the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model.
The VSEPR Model
•A covalent bond forms between two atoms when a pair of electrons occupies the space between the atoms.
•This is a bonding pair of electrons.
•Such a region is an electron domain.
•A nonbonding pair or lone pair of electrons defines an electron domain located principally on one atom. •Example: NH3 has three bonding pairs and one lone pair.
•VSEPR predicts that the best arrangement of electron domains is the one
   that minimizes the repulsions among them.
•The arrangement of electron domains about the central atom of a molecule is its electron-domain geometry.
•There are five different electron-domain geometries:
•linear (two electron domains), trigonal planar (three domains), tetrahedral (four domains), trigonal bipyramidal (five domains) and octahedral (six domains).
•The molecular geometry is the arrangement of the atoms in space. •To determine the shape of a molecule we must distinguish between
lone pairs and bonding pairs.
•We use the electron-domain geometry to help us predict the molecular geometry.
•Draw the Lewis structure.
•Count the total number of electron domains around the central atom.
•Arrange the electron domains in one of the five geometries to minimize electron-electron repulsion.
•Next, determine the 3-D structure of the molecule.
•We ignore lone pairs in the molecular geometry. •Describe the molecular geometry in terms of the the bonded atoms.
•Multiple bonds are counted as one electron domain.
The Effect of Nonbonding Electrons and Multiple Bonds on Bond Angles
We refine VSEPR to predict and explain slight distortions from “ideal” geometries. •Consider three molecules with tetrahedral electron domain geometries: CH4, NH3, and H2O.
angular arrangement of
•By experiment, the H–X–H bond angle decreases from C (109.5° in CH4) to N (107° in NH3) to O (104.5° in H2O). •A bonding pair of electrons is attracted by two nuclei. They do not repel as much as lone pairs which are primarily attracted by only one nucleus.
•Electron domains for nonbonding electron pairs thus exert greater repulsive forces on adjacent electron domains.
•They tend to compress the bond angles.
•The bond angle decreases as the number of nonbonding pairs increases.•Similarly, electrons in multiple bonds repel more than electrons in single bonds (e.g., in Cl2CO the O–C–Cl angle is 124.3°, and the Cl–C–Cl bond angle is 111.4°).
 •We will encounter eleven basic molecular shapes:
•three atoms (AB2): •linear
•bent
•four atoms (AB3):
•trigonal planar •trigonal pyramidal
•t-shaped
•five atoms (AB4): •tetrahedral
•square planar •seesaw
•six atoms (AB5): •trigonal bipyramidal •square pyramidal
•seven atoms (AB6): •octahedral

        Molecules with Expanded Valence Shells
•Atoms that have expanded octets have five electron domains (trigonal bipyramidal) or six electron domains (octahedral) electron-domain geometries.
•Trigonal bipyramidal structures have a plane containing three electron pairs.
•The fourth and fifth electron pairs are located above and below this plane. •In this structure two trigonal pyramids share a base.
•For octahedral structures, there is a plane containing four electron pairs.
•Similarly, the fifth and sixth electron pairs are located above and below this plane. •Two square pyramids share a base.
•Consider a trigonal bipyramid.
•The three electron pairs in the plane are called equatorial.
•The two electron pairs above and below this plane are called axial.
•The axial electron pairs are 180° apart and 90° to the equatorial electrons.
•The equatorial electron pairs are 120° apart.
•To minimize electron–electron repulsion, nonbonding pairs are always placed in equatorial positions and bonding pairs are placed in either axial or equatorial positions.
•Consider an octahedron.
•The four electron pairs in the plane are at 90° to each other.
•The two axial electron pairs are 180° apart and at 90° to the electrons in the plane.
•Because of the symmetry of the system, each position is equivalent.
•If we have five bonding pairs and one lone pair, it does not matter where the lone pair is placed.
• The molecular geometry is square pyramidal.•If two non-bonding pairs are present, the repulsions are minimized by pointing them toward opposite sides of the octahedron.•The molecular geometry is square planar.
 Shapes of Larger Molecules
•In acetic acid, CH3COOH, there are three interior atoms: two C and one O.
•We assign the molecular (and electron-domain) geometry about each interior atom separately:
•The geometry around the first C is tetrahedral.
•The geometry around the second C is trigonal planar. •The geometry around the O is bent (tetrahedral).
Molecular Shape and Molecular Polarity
•Polar molecules interact with electric fields.
•We previously saw that binary compounds are polar if their centers of negative and positive charge do not coincide.
•If two charges, equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, are separated by a distance d, then a dipole is established. •The dipole moment, μ is given by μ = Qr where Q is the magnitude of the charge.
•We can extend this to polyatomic molecules.
•For each bond in a polyatomic molecule, we can consider the bond dipole.
•The dipole moment due only to the two atoms in the bond is the bond dipole.
•Because bond dipoles and dipole moments are vector quantities, the orientation of these individual dipole moments
determines whether the molecule has an overall dipole moment.
•In CO2 each ∂+C−O∂– dipole is canceled because the molecule is linear. •In H2O, the ∂+H−O∂– dipoles do not cancel because the molecule is bent.
•It is possible for a molecule with polar bonds to be either polar or nonpolar. •Example:
•For diatomic molecules:
•polar bonds always result in an overall dipole moment.
•For triatomic molecules:
•if the molecular geometry is bent, there is an overall dipole moment.
•if the molecular geometry is linear and the B atoms are the same, there is no overall dipole moment.
•if the molecular geometry is linear and the B atoms are different, there is an overall dipole moment. •For molecules with four atoms:
•if the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal, there is an overall dipole moment.
•if the molecular geometry is trigonal planar and the B atoms are identical, there is no overall dipole μ.
•if the molecular geometry is trigonal planar and the B atoms are different, there is an overall dipole μ. 
Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap
•Lewis structures and VSEPR theory give us the shape and location of electrons in a molecule.
•They do not explain why a chemical bond forms.
•How can quantum mechanics be used to account for molecular shape? What orbitals are involved in bonding? •We use valence-bond theory.
•A covalent bond forms when the orbitals on two atoms overlap.
•The shared region of space between the orbitals is called the orbital overlap.
•There are two electrons (usually one from each atom) of opposite spin in the orbital overlap. •As two nuclei approach each other their atomic orbitals overlap.
•As the amount of overlap increases, the energy of the interaction decreases. •At some distance the minimum energy is reached.
•The minimum energy corresponds to the bonding distance (or bond length).
•As the two atoms get closer, their nuclei begin to repel and the energy increases.
•At the bonding distance, the attractive forces between nuclei and electrons just balance the repulsive forces (nucleus-nucleus, electron-electron).
Hybrid Orbitals
•We can apply the idea of orbital overlap and valence-bond theory to polyatomic molecules.
sp Hybrid Orbitals
•Consider the BeF2 molecule.
•Be has a 1s22s2 electron configuration.
•There is no unpaired electron available for bonding.
•We conclude that the atomic orbitals are not adequate to describe orbitals in molecules.
•We know that the F–Be–F bond angle is 180° (VSEPR theory).
•We also know that one electron from Be is shared with each one of the unpaired electrons from F.
•We assume that the Be orbitals in the Be–F bond are 180° apart.•We could promote an electron from the 2s orbital on Be to the 2p orbital to get two unpaired electrons for bonding. •BUT the geometry is still not explained.
 •We can solve the problem by allowing the 2s and one 2p orbital on Be to mix or form two new hybrid orbitals (a process called hybridization). •The two equivalent hybrid orbitals that result from mixing an s and
a p orbital and are called sp hybrid orbitals.
•The two lobes of an sp hybrid orbital are 180° apart.
•According to the valence-bond model, a linear arrangement of
electron domains implies sp hybridization.
•Since only one of 2p orbitals of Be has been used in hybridization, there
are two unhybridized p orbitals remaining on Be.
•The electrons in the sp hybrid orbital form shared electron bonds with the two fluorine atoms.
sp2 and sp3 Hybrid Orbitals
•Important: when we mix n atomic orbitals we must get n hybrid orbitals.
•Three sp2 hybrid orbitals are formed from hybridization of one s and two p orbitals.
•Thus, there is one unhybridized p orbital remaining.
•The large lobes of the sp2 hybrids lie in a trigonal plane.
•Molecules with trigonal planar electron-pair geometries have sp2 orbitals on the central atom.
•Four sp3 hybrid orbitals are formed from hybridization of one s and three p orbitals. •Therefore, there are four large lobes.
•Each lobe points towards the vertex of a tetrahedron.
•The angle between the large lobes is 109.5°.
•Molecules with tetrahedral electron pair geometries are sp3 hybridized. Hybridization Involving d Orbitals
•Since there are only three p orbitals, trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral electron-pair geometries must involve d orbitals.
•Trigonal bipyramidal electron pair geometries require sp3d hybridization. •Octahedral electron pair geometries require sp3d2 hybridization. •Electron pair VSEPR geometry corresponds well with the hybridization.
•Use of d orbitals in making hybrid orbitals corresponds well with the idea of an expanded octet.
Summary- We need to know the electron-domain geometry before we can assign hybridization.
•To assign hybridization:
•Draw a Lewis structure.
•Assign the electron-domain geometry using VSEPR theory.
•Specify the hybridization required to accommodate the electron pairs based on their geometric arrangement. •Name the geometry by the positions of the atoms.
Multiple Bonds- In the covalent bonds we have seen so far the electron density has been concentrated symmetrically about the internuclear axis.
•Sigma (σ) bonds: electron density lies on the axis between the nuclei. •All single bonds are σ bonds.
•What about overlap in multiple bonds?
•Pi (π) bonds: electron density lies above and below the plane of the nuclei.
•A double bond consists of one σ bond and one π bond. Bond Order •A triple bond has one σ bond and two π bonds.
•Bond order = 1 for a single bond. •Bond order = 2 for a double bond. •Bond order = 3 for a triple bond.
•Often, the p orbitals involved in π bonding come from unhybridized orbitals. •For example: ethylene, C2H4, has:
•One σ and one π bond.
•Both C atoms are sp2 hybridized.
•Both C atoms have trigonal planar electron-pair and molecular geometries.
•For example: acetylene, C2H2:•The electron-domain geometry of each C is linear. •Therefore, the C atoms are sp hybridized.•The sp hybrid orbitals form the C–C and C–H σ bonds. •There are two unhybridized p orbitals on each C atom.
•Both unhybridized p orbitals form the two π bonds;
•One π bond is above and below the plane of the nuclei; •One π bond is in front and behind the plane of the nuclei.
•For triple bonds, one π bond is always above and below and the other is in front and behind the plane of the nuclei.
Delocalized π Bonding- So far all the bonds we have encountered are localized between two nuclei.
•In the case of benzene:
•There are six C–C σ bonds and six C–H σ bonds.
•Each C atom is sp2 hybridized.
•There is one unhybridized p orbital on each carbon atom, resulting in six unhybridized carbon p orbitals in a ring.
•In benzene there are two options for the three π bonds:
•localized between carbon atoms or
•delocalized over the entire ring (i.e., the π electrons are shared by all six carbon atoms).
•Experimentally, all C–C bonds are the same length in benzene. Therefore, all C–C bonds are of the same type (recall single bonds are longer than double bonds).
General Conclusions
•Every pair of bonded atoms shares one or more pairs of electrons.
•Two electrons shared between atoms on the same axis as the nuclei are σ bonds.
•σ bonds are always localized in the region between two bonded atoms.
•If two atoms share more than one pair of electrons, the additional pairs form π bonds. •When resonance structures are possible, delocalization is also possible.
